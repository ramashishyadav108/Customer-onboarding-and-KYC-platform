# Spec Skill — Story Decomposition & Feature Generation

## Usage

```
/spec specs/brd/brd.md
```

Pass the path to the approved BRD as the argument. Produces epics, stories, a dependency graph, and a `features.json` for session chaining.

---

## Overview

This is the second gate in the SDLC pipeline. The planner agent reads an approved BRD and decomposes it into structured, independently executable units of work. Every story gets testable acceptance criteria, a layer assignment, and a dependency group. A machine-readable `features.json` is generated from those criteria so the evaluator can track pass/fail state across sessions.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Read the BRD

Read the file at the path provided as the argument. Confirm the document exists and is an approved BRD. If the file is missing, halt and ask the human to run `/brd` first.

### Step 2 — Decompose into Epics

Group related functionality into epics. Rules:
- Each epic represents a coherent vertical slice of the system (e.g., "User Authentication", "Data Ingestion", "Reporting")
- Each epic contains 3-5 stories. Never fewer than 2, never more than 5.
- Epic IDs use the format: `E1`, `E2`, `E3` ...

### Step 3 — Write Stories

For each story:

**Story ID:** `E{n}-S{n}` (e.g., `E1-S2`)

**Required fields per story:**
- `title`: Short imperative phrase (e.g., "User can register with email and password")
- `description`: 2-4 sentences of context and motivation
- `acceptance_criteria`: 3-6 items. Each criterion must be:
  - Testable (can be verified by running code or inspecting output)
  - Specific (includes concrete values, states, or behaviors)
  - Not vague ("works properly", "loads fast" are not acceptable)
- `layer`: One of `Types` | `Config` | `Repository` | `Service` | `API` | `UI`
- `group`: Dependency group letter (`A`, `B`, `C` ...) — see Step 4
- `depends_on`: List of story IDs this story depends on (empty list if group A)

### Step 4 — Build the Dependency Graph

Write `specs/stories/dependency-graph.md` with:
- Group A: stories with no dependencies (can run in parallel)
- Group B: stories that depend only on Group A
- Group C: stories that depend on Group B (and/or A)
- ... and so on

Format each group as a table showing Story ID, Title, Layer, and Dependencies.

Rules:
- No circular dependencies. Validate before writing.
- Stories in the same group must be independently executable in parallel.
- Foundation layers (Types, Config, Repository) should appear in earlier groups.
- UI stories typically appear in later groups.

### Step 5 — Write Individual Story Files

Write each story to: `specs/stories/E{n}-S{n}.md`

Each file includes: ID, title, description, acceptance criteria, layer, group, depends_on.

### Step 6 — Generate `features.json`

This is the key enhancement over forge_v2. Transform every acceptance criterion into one or more testable features.

**Mapping rule:** Each acceptance criterion produces 1-3 feature entries. The feature description must be a specific, observable behavior. Each feature has executable steps describing how to verify it.

**Output file:** `specs/features.json`

**Schema for each feature entry:**

```json
{
  "id": "F001",
  "category": "functional",
  "story": "E1-S1",
  "group": "A",
  "description": "User registration endpoint returns 201 with user ID on valid input",
  "steps": [
    "POST /api/auth/register with valid email and password",
    "Assert response status is 201",
    "Assert response body contains a non-null userId field"
  ],
  "passes": false,
  "last_evaluated": null,
  "failure_reason": null,
  "failure_layer": null
}
```

**Field rules:**
- `id`: Sequential, zero-padded to 3 digits (`F001`, `F002` ...)
- `category`: `functional` | `integration` | `ui` | `security` | `performance`
- `story`: Story ID this feature belongs to
- `group`: Inherited from the story's dependency group
- `description`: Single sentence, specific and observable
- `steps`: Ordered list of verification steps (at least 2)
- `passes`: Always `false` at generation time
- `last_evaluated`: Always `null` at generation time
- `failure_reason`: Always `null` at generation time
- `failure_layer`: Always `null` at generation time

Every acceptance criterion must map to at least one feature. No criteria may be omitted.

### Step 7 — Present for Human Review

Display:
1. Epic summary table (ID, title, story count, groups covered)
2. Dependency graph overview
3. Total story count, total feature count
4. Ask: "Does this decomposition look correct? Approve to proceed to `/design`, or provide corrections."

---

## Output

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs/stories/dependency-graph.md` | Parallel execution groups with dependency mapping |
| `specs/stories/E{n}-S{n}.md` | One file per story |
| `specs/features.json` | Machine-readable feature list for evaluator |

---

## Gate

**Human review is required before proceeding to `/design`.**

Do not auto-advance. Every story must have testable criteria, a layer assignment, and a group before approval is requested.

Pre-approval checklist:
- [ ] Every story has 3-6 specific, testable acceptance criteria
- [ ] Every story has a layer assignment
- [ ] Every story has a group assignment
- [ ] No circular dependencies in the graph
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion maps to at least one feature in `features.json`
- [ ] All `passes` fields are `false`

---

## Gotchas

- **Vague criteria are rejected.** "The system works properly" fails the gate. Rewrite as an observable behavior.
- **Missing layers break agent routing.** Every story needs a layer so the builder knows which agent handles it.
- **Circular dependencies deadlock the pipeline.** Validate the graph before writing.
- **More than 5 stories per epic** signals the epic is too broad — split it.
- **Do not skip human review.** The dependency graph must be confirmed before design begins.
- **features.json must cover all criteria.** The evaluator uses this file to track pipeline health across sessions.
