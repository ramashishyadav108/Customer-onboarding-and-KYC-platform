# Code Generation Skill

Reference skill for generator teammates. Read this before writing any code.

---

## Six Quality Principles

### 1. Small Modules — One File, One Responsibility
- Each file must have a single, clearly named responsibility.
- **Warning threshold:** 200 lines — add a comment noting the file is growing large.
- **Block threshold:** 300 lines — do not submit. Split before opening a PR.
- If you hit 300 lines, decompose into sub-modules and re-export from an index file.

### 2. Static Typing — Annotate Everything
- Every function parameter, return value, and variable must have an explicit type.
- **TypeScript:** Zero `any`. Use `unknown` + type guard if the shape is truly unknown.
- **Python:** Full type hints on all functions. Use `TypeVar`, `Generic`, `Protocol` where appropriate.
- Type aliases for domain concepts (`UserId = str`, `type OrderId = string`).

### 3. Functions Under 50 Lines
- If a function body exceeds 50 lines, decompose it into named sub-functions.
- Each sub-function should be testable in isolation.
- Use descriptive names that read as a sentence: `validateOrderItems`, `buildPaymentPayload`.
- Avoid deeply nested control flow — extract branches into named helpers.

### 4. Single Owner for State Mutations
- Every state-creating operation (DB insert, file write, queue publish) must have exactly ONE call site.
- If a route handler creates a record, the service it calls must receive the ID — not create a second record.
- **Anti-pattern:** Route creates Task, then calls `service.start(query)` which also creates a Task → duplicate records.
- **Correct pattern:** Route creates Task with ID, then calls `service.start(task_id)` which operates on the existing record.
- When a background task or async flow needs a resource, pass the ID, don't re-create it.
- Test this explicitly: after calling the endpoint, assert the exact count of records created (e.g., `assert db.query(Task).count() == 1`).

### 5. Explicit Error Handling
- Define typed error classes per domain (e.g., `class OrderNotFoundError extends AppError`).
- Never use bare `except Exception` or `catch (e: any)`.
- All error paths must be covered by tests.
- Propagate errors up with context; do not swallow silently.
- In TypeScript: use `Result<T, E>` or typed throws with JSDoc `@throws`.

### 6. No Dead Code
- Every line of code must trace to a user story or a technical requirement.
- Do not leave commented-out code in PRs.
- Remove unused imports, variables, and parameters immediately.
- If code is speculative ("might need later"), do not include it.

### 7. Self-Documenting — Names Over Comments
- Variable and function names should make comments unnecessary.
- Types act as documentation — a well-typed function signature is its own doc.
- Use comments only for non-obvious decisions (algorithm choice, regulatory constraints).
- Avoid `// TODO` in submitted code — file a story instead.

## Code Patterns

### Test Structure: Arrange → Act → Assert
```
// Arrange
const order = buildOrder({ status: "pending" });
// Act
const result = processOrder(order);
// Assert
expect(result.status).toBe("confirmed");
```

### Typed Error Classes
```typescript
class DomainError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string, public readonly code: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = this.constructor.name;
  }
}
class OrderNotFoundError extends DomainError {
  constructor(orderId: OrderId) {
    super(`Order ${orderId} not found`, "ORDER_NOT_FOUND");
  }
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files:** `kebab-case.ts` for TypeScript, `snake_case.py` for Python.
- **Functions/methods:** `camelCase` (TS), `snake_case` (Python).
- **Types/classes:** `PascalCase` in both languages.
- **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.
- **Booleans:** prefix with `is`, `has`, `can`, `should`.

### Database Session Lifecycle (Python/FastAPI)
- Use `async_sessionmaker` with FastAPI `Depends()` for dependency injection — never create sessions manually per request.
- Engine and session factory created once in `lifespan`, stored on `app.state`, disposed on shutdown.
- Sessions auto-close via `async with` — never leave sessions open.
- Tests override the session dependency to use a test DB, not the dev DB.

```python
# CORRECT — lifespan manages engine lifecycle
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    engine = create_async_engine(settings.DATABASE_URL)
    app.state.session_factory = async_sessionmaker(engine)
    yield
    await engine.dispose()

# CORRECT — session via dependency injection
async def get_db(request: Request) -> AsyncGenerator[AsyncSession, None]:
    async with request.app.state.session_factory() as session:
        yield session

DbSession = Annotated[AsyncSession, Depends(get_db)]
```

### Background Tasks Must Be Tracked
- Every background task must have a corresponding DB record with a status field (`pending`, `running`, `completed`, `failed`).
- The route creates the record (status=`pending`), then starts the background task with the record's ID.
- The background task updates the record on completion or failure — never fire-and-forget.
- Wrap the entire background task body in try/except: on failure, update the record to `failed` with error details and log the exception.

```python
# CORRECT — tracked background task
@router.post("/tasks")
async def create_task(request: TaskRequest, db: DbSession, background_tasks: BackgroundTasks):
    task = Task(query=request.query, status="pending")
    db.add(task)
    await db.commit()
    background_tasks.add_task(run_task, task.id)  # pass ID, not the object
    return {"task_id": task.id, "status": "pending"}

async def run_task(task_id: UUID) -> None:
    async with get_session() as db:
        task = await db.get(Task, task_id)
        try:
            task.status = "running"
            await db.commit()
            result = await do_work(task.query)
            task.status = "completed"
            task.result = result
        except Exception as e:
            logger.exception("Task failed", extra={"task_id": str(task_id)})
            task.status = "failed"
            task.error = str(e)
        finally:
            await db.commit()
```

### CORS Must Be Environment-Configured
- Never use `allow_origins=["*"]` with `allow_credentials=True` — this is a security vulnerability.
- Read allowed origins from an environment variable, default to `localhost` only.

```python
# CORRECT — env-configured CORS
allowed_origins = settings.ALLOWED_ORIGINS.split(",")  # from .env
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=allowed_origins,
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

### Health Check Must Verify Dependencies
- Health endpoint must test critical dependencies (DB, cache, external APIs), not just return `{"status": "ok"}`.
- Return 503 if any dependency is unreachable.

```python
@router.get("/health")
async def health(db: DbSession) -> dict:
    try:
        await db.execute(text("SELECT 1"))
        return {"status": "ok", "db": "connected"}
    except Exception:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="Database unreachable")
```

### Request ID Middleware
- Add middleware that generates a unique `request_id` per request and includes it in all log entries and error responses.
- This enables tracing a single user request across all service logs.

```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def add_request_id(request: Request, call_next):
    request_id = str(uuid4())
    request.state.request_id = request_id
    response = await call_next(request)
    response.headers["X-Request-ID"] = request_id
    return response
```

## Testing Rules — TDD Mandatory

**"Coverage isn't about bug prevention — it's about guaranteeing the agent has double-checked the behavior of every line of code it wrote."** — Steve Krenzel

1. **Tests FIRST, then code (TDD):**
   - Write a failing test that defines expected behavior
   - Run it — verify it fails for the right reason
   - Write the minimum code to make it pass
   - Run it — verify it passes
   - Refactor if needed, re-run tests
   - Commit
2. **100% meaningful coverage** — every branch, every error path. At 100%, any uncovered line is an immediate signal of missing verification. The ratchet gate BLOCKS below 80%.
3. **Only mock external boundaries:** databases, third-party APIs, file I/O, clocks.
4. **Never mock business logic** — if you mock a service to test another service, you are hiding bugs.
5. **Isolate tests from .env files:** When testing settings/config that uses pydantic-settings or dotenv, pass `_env_file=None` (pydantic) or mock `dotenv.load_dotenv` to prevent the developer's `.env` from leaking into tests. Tests must be self-contained — they must pass regardless of what's in the local `.env`.
6. **Use async-compatible connection strings:** When using async frameworks (SQLAlchemy async, asyncpg), defaults must use the async driver scheme (e.g., `postgresql+asyncpg://` not `postgresql://`). The sync scheme will fail at runtime with a cryptic driver error.
5. **Realistic test data** — use domain-representative values (real-looking emails, valid UUIDs, plausible amounts). Never `"foo"`, `123`, or `"test"`.
6. Test names describe behavior: `"returns 404 when order does not exist"`, not `"test order"`.
7. **Integration tests for multi-step flows:** When a route triggers a background task or async flow (e.g., POST creates a record then starts processing), write a test that calls the endpoint and asserts the FINAL state — not just that each unit works alone. Assert exact record counts: `assert db.query(Task).count() == 1` after one API call.

---

## LLM Integration — Structured Output Mandatory

When generated code calls any LLM (Claude, GPT, or other), follow these rules:

### 1. Always Use Structured Output

Use `tool_use` / `function_calling` / `response_format: { type: "json_schema", json_schema: ... }` for every LLM call. Never parse free-text responses with regex or string splitting.

### 2. Define a Response Schema

Every LLM call must have a typed model for the expected response:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Literal

class ClassificationResult(BaseModel):
    category: str
    confidence: Literal["high", "medium", "low"]
    reasoning: str
```

```typescript
interface ClassificationResult {
  category: string;
  confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low";
  reasoning: string;
}
```

### 3. Validate Before Using

Parse the LLM response through the schema. If validation fails:
1. Retry once with an explicit correction prompt: "Your response did not match the required schema. Required: {schema}. Please respond again."
2. If second attempt fails, raise a typed error — do not fall back to a default value.

### 4. No Silent Fallbacks

Never write:
```python
# WRONG — hides bugs that compound
try:
    result = await call_llm(prompt)
    parsed = ResponseModel.model_validate_json(result)
except Exception:
    parsed = ResponseModel(category="unknown", confidence="low", reasoning="")
```

Instead:
```python
# CORRECT — caller decides how to handle failure
class LLMResponseError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, raw_response: str, validation_error: str):
        self.raw_response = raw_response
        self.validation_error = validation_error
        super().__init__(f"LLM response validation failed: {validation_error}")

try:
    result = await call_llm(prompt)
    parsed = ResponseModel.model_validate_json(result)
except ValidationError as e:
    raise LLMResponseError(raw_response=result, validation_error=str(e))
```

### 5. Log Raw Responses

Always log the raw LLM response at DEBUG level before parsing:

```python
logger.debug(
    "LLM response received",
    extra={
        "provider": self._provider_name,
        "model": self._model,
        "prompt_tokens": response.usage.input_tokens,
        "completion_tokens": response.usage.output_tokens,
        "raw_content": response.content[:1000],
        "latency_ms": round(elapsed_ms, 2),
    },
)
```

---

## External API Integration

When generated code calls any external API (third-party services, partner APIs, cloud services), follow these rules. See `.claude/skills/code-gen/references/api-integration-patterns.md` for full templates.

### Service Wrapper Pattern (Mandatory)

Every external API gets a dedicated wrapper class. This is the ONLY file that imports the SDK or makes HTTP calls to that service.

```
Business Logic (process_service.py)
    ↓ calls typed methods
API Wrapper (external_client.py)    ← only file that imports SDK / makes HTTP calls
    ↓ calls
External API
```

Rules:
- One wrapper class per external API
- Wrapper exposes project-internal typed models, not SDK types
- Business logic never sees SDK response objects — only your domain types
- The wrapper is the mock boundary in tests

### Error Taxonomy (Mandatory)

Every wrapper classifies errors into typed categories:

```python
class ApiTransientError(Exception):
    """Retryable: 429, 502, 503, timeout, connection reset."""
    pass

class ApiPermanentError(Exception):
    """Not retryable: 400, 401, 403, 404, schema mismatch."""
    pass

class ApiRateLimitError(ApiTransientError):
    """Rate limited with backoff hint."""
    def __init__(self, message: str, retry_after: float | None = None):
        super().__init__(message)
        self.retry_after = retry_after
```

- Business logic catches `ApiTransientError` to retry/degrade, `ApiPermanentError` to fail fast
- No bare `except Exception` in any API-calling code
- All exceptions carry HTTP status code and response body for debugging

### Retry and Rate Limiting

- Retry config lives in `config.yml` under `external_apis.{service_name}.retry`, not hardcoded
- Wrapper applies exponential backoff internally — business logic is unaware of retries
- Respect `Retry-After` headers when present
- Log every retry attempt at WARNING level

### Async Bridging

When an SDK is synchronous but the backend is async:
- Use `asyncio.to_thread()` only inside the wrapper class
- Never bridge in business logic
- Prefer async SDKs or HTTP clients when available

### Secrets

- API keys in `.env` only, loaded via config layer
- Wrapper reads from injected config, never from `os.environ` directly
- `.env.example` committed with placeholder values

---

## Production Standards

These standards apply to ALL generated code, not just API wrappers or LLM calls.

### Structured Logging

All generated services must use structured logging with `extra` dicts:

```python
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# CORRECT — structured fields for JSON log formatters
logger.info("Document processed", extra={
    "document_id": doc.id,
    "processing_time_ms": round(elapsed_ms, 2),
    "output_size_bytes": len(result),
})

# WRONG — data interpolated into message string
logger.info(f"Document {doc.id} processed in {elapsed_ms}ms")
```

```typescript
// CORRECT — structured logger
logger.info("Document processed", {
  documentId: doc.id,
  processingTimeMs: Math.round(elapsedMs),
  outputSizeBytes: result.length,
});

// WRONG — template literal message
logger.info(`Document ${doc.id} processed in ${elapsedMs}ms`);
```

Rules:
- Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` (Python) or scoped logger (TypeScript) at module level
- INFO for business events (request received, document processed, job completed)
- WARNING for recoverable issues (retry triggered, fallback used, slow response)
- ERROR for failures requiring attention (unhandled exception, data corruption, external service down)
- DEBUG for troubleshooting data (raw payloads, intermediate state, timing breakdowns)
- Never log secrets, tokens, passwords, or PII
- Log at service boundaries: incoming requests, outgoing calls, business decisions

### Exception Handling

```python
# CORRECT — typed exception with context
class DocumentProcessingError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, document_id: str, stage: str, cause: Exception):
        self.document_id = document_id
        self.stage = stage
        self.cause = cause
        super().__init__(f"Failed at {stage} for document {document_id}: {cause}")

# WRONG — bare except swallowing the error
try:
    result = process(doc)
except Exception:
    result = default_value
```

Rules:
- Define typed exception classes per domain (not per function)
- Every exception carries enough context to debug without the stack trace
- Never catch `Exception` or `BaseException` unless re-raising or logging at a top-level boundary
- No silent fallbacks — if an operation fails, the caller must know
- API route handlers catch domain exceptions and map to HTTP error responses

### Structured Error Responses

All API error responses follow a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "DOCUMENT_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Document with ID abc123 does not exist",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

Rules:
- `code` is a machine-readable UPPER_SNAKE_CASE string enum
- `message` is human-readable
- `details` is optional structured context
- HTTP status mapping: 400 validation, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 422 processing error, 500 internal

### Request/Response Validation

- All API inputs validated via Pydantic models (Python) or Zod schemas (TypeScript)
- Validation errors return 400 with field-level messages
- All API outputs serialized through response models — never return raw dicts or ORM objects

### Configuration

- All configurable values in `config.yml` or environment variables
- No magic numbers or hardcoded strings in business logic
- Config loaded once at startup, injected into services via constructor
- Defaults provided for all non-secret config values

---

## Parallel Execution

- **File ownership:** consult `component-map.md` before touching any file.
- **Plan approval required** before starting parallel work.
- **Shared interfaces:** message teammates before changing a type or API contract that crosses boundaries.
- **Task sizing:** aim for 5–6 discrete tasks per teammate per sprint cycle.
- **Conflicts:** if two teammates need the same file, one blocks; do not merge partial changes.

---

## Gotchas (Things That Cause Review Failures)

- Importing upward across layers (UI importing from repository layer)
- Functions exceeding 50 lines without decomposition
- Untyped values — `any`, missing return types, unannotated parameters
- Broad exception catches without re-raise or typed handling
- Mocking business logic in unit tests
- Generic test data (`"test"`, `0`, `null` as stand-ins for real domain values)
- Commented-out code in the submitted diff
- Missing error-path test coverage
- Teammates editing the same file in the same sprint without coordination
- **Free-text LLM parsing** — Never use regex to parse LLM output. Use structured output (tool_use / JSON mode).
- **Silent fallback on LLM error** — `except Exception: return default` hides compounding bugs. Raise typed errors.
- **Missing raw response logging** — Always log raw LLM response at DEBUG before parsing. This is the debugging ground truth.
- **Direct SDK imports outside wrapper** — All SDK imports must be inside the wrapper class file. Business logic imports your wrapper, not the SDK.
- **Bare except on API calls** — Catch `ApiTransientError` and `ApiPermanentError` specifically. Never `except Exception`.
- **Hardcoded retry config** — Retry attempts, backoff, and timeout belong in `config.yml`, not in code.
- **Missing structured logging in API wrapper** — Every request/response/error must be logged with structured fields (service, operation, attempt, latency_ms).
- **f-string log messages** — Use `extra` dict for structured fields, not string interpolation. Structured logs are searchable; f-strings are not.
- **Missing logging at service boundaries** — Every incoming request and outgoing call must be logged with timing and status.
- **Raw dict API responses** — Always serialize through a response model. Raw dicts bypass validation and leak internal structure.
- **Magic numbers** — All thresholds, limits, timeouts, and configuration belong in `config.yml`.
- **.env leaking into tests** — Tests that validate "missing config raises error" will pass in CI but fail locally if `.env` has the value. Always pass `_env_file=None` in pydantic-settings tests.
- **Sync DB driver in async app** — `postgresql://` uses psycopg2 (sync). Async SQLAlchemy needs `postgresql+asyncpg://`. Always match the driver scheme to the engine type.
- **Duplicate record creation** — Route creates a record, then calls a service that creates the same record again. Pass the ID, don't re-create. Test with `assert count == 1` after one API call.
- **Manual session creation** — Never create DB sessions manually per request. Use `Depends(get_db)` with `async_sessionmaker`. Manual sessions leak connections.
- **Fire-and-forget background tasks** — Every background task must update a DB record on completion or failure. No `background_tasks.add_task(fn)` without status tracking.
- **CORS allow_origins=["*"]** — Never use wildcard origins with `allow_credentials=True`. Read origins from env var, default to localhost.
- **Health check returns OK without checking DB** — Health endpoint must `SELECT 1` against the database. A healthy HTTP server with a dead DB is not healthy.
- **Engine not disposed on shutdown** — Always `await engine.dispose()` in the lifespan's teardown. Leaked connections exhaust the pool.
- **No request ID tracing** — Add middleware that generates a UUID per request, injects into logs and response headers. Without it, errors can't be traced to requests.
- **Deprecated startup/shutdown events** — Use `@asynccontextmanager` lifespan, not `@app.on_event("startup")`. The event-based API is deprecated in FastAPI.
- **Thread pool exhaustion** — `asyncio.to_thread()` uses a default pool of ~5 workers. Under concurrent load, blocking SDK calls exhaust the pool. Set `loop.set_default_executor(ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20))` or use async clients.
