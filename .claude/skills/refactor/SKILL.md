# Refactor Skill — Quality-Driven Code Improvement

## Usage

```
/refactor src/service/extraction.py
/refactor src/repository/
```

Provide a file path or directory. The skill analyzes the target against six quality principles, plans the changes, and executes them one principle at a time.

---

## Overview

Refactoring improves the internal structure of existing code without changing its observable behavior. No new features. No behavior changes. Every change must trace to a violation of one of the six quality principles.

---

## Steps

### Step 1 — Read Quality Principles

Read `.claude/skills/code-gen/SKILL.md` in full. The six principles are the refactoring standard. Every change planned in Step 4 must cite a specific principle.

### Step 2 — Analyze Current State

For each file in the target path:

- **Architecture compliance:** does the file import from a layer above it? (see layering rules in `architecture/SKILL.md`)
- **Function lengths:** count lines in each function. Flag any over 50 lines.
- **Type coverage:** identify any `any` (TypeScript) or missing type hints (Python). Count unannotated parameters and return types.
- **Test coverage baseline:** run the test suite and record current pass/fail counts and coverage percentage.
- **Dead code:** identify unused imports, unreachable branches, commented-out code.
- **Documentation style:** identify comments that restate the code rather than explaining non-obvious decisions.

Record findings in a structured list before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Identify Violations

Map each finding from Step 2 to one of the six principles:
1. Small Modules — file exceeds 300 lines (block) or 200 lines (warning).
2. Static Typing — `any`, missing annotations, untyped domain concepts.
3. Functions Under 50 Lines — function body exceeds 50 lines.
4. Explicit Error Handling — bare `except`, untyped catches, swallowed errors.
5. No Dead Code — unused imports, commented-out code, unreachable branches.
6. Self-Documenting — comments that restate what the code does, not why.

Only violations of these six principles justify a change. Do not refactor code that complies with all six principles.

### Step 4 — Plan Changes with Superpowers

Invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` to produce a structured refactoring plan. This ensures the plan is reviewed before execution and prevents ad-hoc changes that drift from the six principles.

Produce a written plan before touching any code:

```
File: src/service/extraction.py
Change: Split extract_data() into extract_raw(), validate_schema(), transform_fields()
Principle: #3 — extract_data() is 87 lines
Risk: One caller in api/routes.py — update import after split

File: src/service/extraction.py
Change: Add return type annotation to all 4 functions
Principle: #2 — return types missing
Risk: None
```

List every file, what will change, which principle it violates, and any known call-site impact.

### Step 5 — Execute One Principle at a Time

Apply changes for one principle across all affected files. Then run the test suite. Then proceed to the next principle.

Order of execution:
1. Static typing (lowest risk, foundation for other changes)
2. Dead code removal
3. Function decomposition
4. Module splitting (if needed)
5. Error handling
6. Self-documenting cleanup

After each principle: run tests, run lint, run type checks. If anything breaks, fix it before moving to the next principle.

### Step 6 — Spawn code-reviewer

After all changes are complete, spawn the `code-reviewer` agent on the full diff.

The reviewer will return findings at three severity levels:
- **BLOCK** — must fix before this refactor is considered complete.
- **WARN** — should fix; document if deferring.
- **INFO** — optional improvement.

### Step 7 — Fix BLOCK Findings

Address every BLOCK finding. Re-run the reviewer after each fix cycle. Maximum 3 retry cycles.

If BLOCK findings remain after 3 cycles, stop and report the unresolved issues. Do not ship code with unresolved BLOCK findings.

---

## Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Tests must pass after every change.** If a refactor breaks a test, fix the code — not the test.
- **No behavior changes.** The refactored code must produce identical outputs for all existing inputs.
- **No new features.** If you identify a missing capability, open a story and use `/improve`.
- **Every change traces to a principle.** If you cannot cite which of the six principles a change addresses, do not make the change.
- **Update all call sites.** When renaming or moving a symbol, update every import and reference before committing.

---

## Output

The target path contains refactored code that:
- Passes the full test suite.
- Has no new lint or type errors.
- Has no BLOCK findings from the code reviewer.
- Has coverage equal to or better than the baseline recorded in Step 2.

---

## Gotchas

- **Refactoring without tests.** If the target code has no tests, write characterization tests before refactoring. Refactoring untested code silently introduces regressions.
- **Big-bang changes.** Applying all principles at once makes failures hard to diagnose. Execute one principle at a time.
- **Renaming without updating imports.** A renamed function that is still referenced by its old name will fail at runtime, not compile time in Python. Search all call sites.
- **Breaking layering while splitting modules.** When extracting a new file, verify it does not introduce an upward dependency.
- **Deleting "unused" code that is used dynamically.** Python's `getattr`, decorator registries, and plugin systems reference symbols by string. Verify with a project-wide search before deleting.
